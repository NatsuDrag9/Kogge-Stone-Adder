# Kogge-Stone-Adder
This is a mini project on implementing a 4-bit Kogge Stone Adder (a type of carry-tree adder) in VHDL using XIlinx Vivado. A Kogge Stone Adder is a carry tree adder (an upgrade of carry-look-ahead adder) which creates a propagator and a generator to calculate the sum and carry. It is one of the most popular adders used commercially.

This was one of the semester projects intended for evaluation to fullfill the requirements of a Bachelor's of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
